Pytorch is an open source deep learning platform by facebook engineering that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment.<br>
You may see how to get started in the official webpage: <a href="https://pytorch.org/">https://pytorch.org/</a>

## <a name="files"></a>Required files
In order to run the notebook file you must download the files bellow:<br>
1) Download and extract `flower_data` to a paste with same name on the project folder <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JlcE8LtZjgLKlDvAGyNb9jJw8un35VeS">Link</a>
  - This folder contains all the images used for training and testing our model, they are already separated into two different folders. 
2) Download and extract `model_final_project.pt` to the project folder <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U4OSKNO1S3fdx4MsuoR2otKJVp6jT2SE">Link</a> 
  - This file contains the parameters values of our model trained if you desired to use it, otherwise you may train the model for the beggin.
